# Signal-noise-removal
Focused on removing noise from a given signal and applied Peak Signal to noise ratio (PSNR) to analyze the denoising performance. Based on the characteristic of its frequency domain and time domain, the denoising process is able to be initialized following with two different denoising techniques: Fourier domain noise removal and Discrete cosine noise removal.
